White Butterfly
Version 1.1
by Linley Henzell

Released under the GPL v3. Source code is available from www.sourceforge.net, project name "white butterfly", and should work on any platform supported by Allegro.

**********************************************

Well, this is my latest shoot-em-up. Choose a fighter and wreak destruction through three pastel-shaded stages.

Each fighter moves at the same speed and is only vulnerable in the cockpit (the small lozenge-shaped white section in the centre). Each has three weapons, which gain power as you use them to destroy things (see the bars on the top left of the screen). When all three have reached a new level, they all power up at once - this means that you will need to balance your use of them. If your White Butterfly has its seekers at level 4 and its cannons at level 1, they'll all function at level 1. Seek harmony!

When you finish a stage you unlock the next stage for replay with the lowest power level of your three weapons. Retry stages to improve the stored level! Also, finishing stage 3 unlocks the Chaos Squid fighter. To help you achieve this, every 2000 points get you an extra life.

Among other things you can choose between windowed and fullscreen mode in the options menu (requires restarting the game). Fullscreen is recommended as it suffers less from slowdown and other glitches. Joysticks and gamepads are supported if Allegro recognises them. You can change the joystick sensitivity by editing the init.txt file.

Version 1.1 makes a few minor cosmetic changes and adds support for a third button, which works the same way as pressing fire1 and fire2 at once (unless you're using the White Butterfly, in which case it will charge up and fire seekers when released). You can also take screenshots with the F1 key - they will be saved in the game directory.

Thanks to:
- the people on the www.shmup-dev.com forums who gave suggestions on the beta, especially monoRAIL, the2bears, terpiscorei and Substance20.
- the developers of the free tools I used to make WB: gcc, Allegro, Code::Blocks, Psycle, Audacity, SFXR and the GIMP.
- Mel, who is very patient.
